# Calendar ToDo Management

A React-based web application that provides a detailed view of tasks for any given date or week.

## Some Features

- **Calendar View**: Displays an overview of a month. Users can navigate through different months.
- **Task Display**: Shows tasks with their date, time, category, and content.
- **Editable Tasks**: Tasks can be edited directly from the list.
- **Deletable Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted with a confirmation popup for safety.
- **Task Completion Toggle**: Tasks can be marked as completed, and a badge shows up for completed tasks.
- **Load More**: Displays tasks in batches and provides a "Load More" button to load subsequent tasks.
- **Task Sorting**: Prioritizes tasks due today, then incomplete future tasks, past incomplete tasks, and finally completed tasks. Sorted further by date and time.
- **Popups & Overlays**: Interactive popups for task editing and deletion, with an overlay for improved UI experience.
